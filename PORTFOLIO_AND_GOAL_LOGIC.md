# How We Calculate Your Money's Future

**Think of this like a weather forecast, but for your money.**

---

## The Two Things We Show You

### 1. Portfolio Tab = "How much money will I have?"
Shows you a number like: **$1,680,000**

### 2. Goal Tab = "Will I reach my specific goal?"
Shows you a percentage like: **83%**

**That's it. Everything else is just explaining HOW we get those numbers.**

---

## Part 1: Where Do We Get Year 1 Numbers?

### For Index Funds (SPY, QQQ, etc.)
We have a special database with predictions:
- **Bull** = Things go well → 9.9%
- **Expected** = Normal year → 6.9%  
- **Bear** = Things go poorly → -2.1%

**Example:** If you have SPY, we use 6.9% for next year.

### For Individual Stocks (Apple, Google, etc.)
Professional analysts predict where the stock will be in 1 year.
- Apple today: $274
- Apple predicted: $285
- Difference: 4.3% growth

### If We Don't Have Data
We use 10% (the stock market's average over the last 100 years).

---

## Part 2: What About Years 2, 3, 4... 10?

**We can't predict specifics that far out.**

So we use history:
- Stocks usually grow **10% per year** on average
- Bonds usually grow **5% per year** on average
- Cash usually grows **3% per year** on average

**Why different from Year 1?** Because analysts can predict 1 year ahead, but not 10 years ahead.

---

## Part 3: 1-Year Goals (The Simple Version)

### The Math
```
Your Money × Growth = Future Money
```

### Real Example
- You have: **$750,000**
- Growth: **6.9%** (that's like adding 6.9%)
- Calculator: $750,000 × 1.069 = **$801,750**

### Did You Hit Your Goal?
- Goal was: **$800,000**
- You'll have: **$801,750** ✓
- **You win!** → 100% chance

**That's all there is to it for 1 year. Simple multiplication.**

---

## Part 4: Multi-Year Goals (The Complex Version, Simplified)

### Why It Gets Complicated

**The stock market is like a roller coaster:**
- Some years: UP 30%! 🎉
- Some years: DOWN 20%! 😰
- **We can't predict which**

### How We Handle Uncertainty

We play out **10,000 different futures**:

**Future #1:** Great first 3 years, bad next 2, then great again → You end with $2.1M ✓  
**Future #2:** Bad first year, then steady growth → You end with $1.8M ✓  
**Future #3:** Really unlucky, lots of down years → You end with $900k ✗  
...  
**Future #10,000:** Mixed results → You end with $1.9M ✓

### Count the Winners
Out of 10,000 futures:
- **8,300** reached your $1M goal ✓
- **1,700** fell short ✗

**Your probability: 8,300 ÷ 10,000 = 83%**

---

## Part 5: Real Examples (With Your Money)

### Example A: Easy 1-Year Goal

**Situation:**
- You have: $500,000
- Your goal: $503,000 (you only need $3,000 more)
- Time: 1 year
- Investment: SPY (index fund)

**What Happens:**
```
Expected: $500,000 × 1.069 = $534,500
Your goal: $503,000
Difference: $31,500 extra! ✓
```

**Result:** 100% chance of success (you're way over!)

---

### Example B: Hard 10-Year Goal

**Situation:**
- You have: $750,000
- Your goal: $2,000,000 (you need to nearly triple it)
- Time: 10 years
- Investment: SPY (index fund)

**What Happens:**
We play out 10,000 possible futures...

**The middle result (median):**
```
Year 1: $750,000 × 1.069 = $801,750
Years 2-10: $801,750 grows at 10%/year = $1,680,000
```

**Your goal:** $2,000,000  
**Middle result:** $1,680,000  
**You're short by:** $320,000 ✗

**Result:** 42% chance of success

**Why only 42%?** 
- 4,200 futures got lucky and reached $2M ✓
- 5,800 futures weren't lucky enough ✗

---

### Example C: Two Portfolios Compared

**Your Portfolio (100% SPY):**
- Year 1 prediction: 6.9%
- 10-year result: **$1,680,000**

**TIME Portfolio (30 different stocks):**
- Year 1 prediction: 13.7% (better!)
- 10-year result: **$1,770,000**

**Why is TIME higher?**
- TIME has better predictions for Year 1 (13.7% vs 6.9%)
- That head start compounds over 10 years
- Extra $90,000!

## Part 6: Why Don't the Two Tabs Match?

### You Might See:
- **Portfolio Tab:** "You'll have $1,680,000"
- **Goal Tab:** "83% chance of hitting $1,000,000"

**Wait, what?**

### Explanation:

**Portfolio Tab** answers: *"What's the most likely amount?"*
- Answer: $1,680,000 (the middle of 10,000 outcomes)

**Goal Tab** answers: *"What are my odds of hitting $1,000,000?"*
- Answer: 83% (8,300 out of 10,000 futures reached it)

**Both can be true!** 

Think of it like this:
- *"What's the most likely temperature tomorrow?"* → 75°F
- *"What are the odds it's above 70°F?"* → 90%

Different questions, different answers.

## Part 7: Common Confusions

### "Why isn't it 100% if I'm way over my goal?"

**For 1 year:** It IS 100% (we use simple math)

**For 10 years:** It's NOT 100% because:
- Bad luck early on can derail you
- The market might crash in Year 2
- Even though the *average* is good, some paths are unlucky

**Real example:**
- You need $1M
- Middle result: $1.68M (way over!)
- But 1,700 out of 10,000 futures still missed it (bad timing)
- So it's 83%, not 100%

---

### "What does 'Expected Scenario' mean?"

**Think of it as the middle guess.**

If 10,000 futures play out:
- 5,000 do better than "expected"
- 5,000 do worse than "expected"
- Expected = the middle (50th place)

Not the average, not the best, not the worst. **The middle.**

---

### "Why three scenarios (Bull/Expected/Bear)?"

**Because the future has a range of possibilities:**

- **Bear** = Things go poorly (5th best out of 100) → Pessimistic
- **Expected** = Normal outcome (50th best out of 100) → Realistic  
- **Bull** = Things go well (95th best out of 100) → Optimistic

**Example:**
- Bear: $900k (bad luck)
- Expected: $1.68M (normal)
- Bull: $2.5M (great luck)

All three are *possible*. Expected is most *likely*.

## Part 8: What You Need to Remember

### The 4 Key Rules:

**1. For 1 year:** We use simple math
```
Your Money × Growth = Future Money
```

**2. For 10+ years:** We play out 10,000 possible futures
```
Some futures lucky ✓
Some futures unlucky ✗
Your % = Winners ÷ 10,000
```

**3. Year 1 is specific:** We use real analyst predictions

**4. Years 2+ are averages:** We use 100-year history (10% for stocks)

---

## Final Thoughts

**These are ESTIMATES, not guarantees.**

Just like a weather forecast:
- ☀️ 80% chance of sun doesn't mean it WON'T rain
- 📈 83% chance of hitting your goal doesn't mean you WILL hit it

**We're showing you the odds based on history and expert predictions.**

The stock market is unpredictable. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.

**But this is the best forecast we can give you.** 🎯
