  "marketContext": "As of Week 22-September 2025, markets set fresh all-time highs this week, driven largely by tech and AI enthusiasm, even as the macro backdrop showed signs of strain. The AI trade remains the dominant force: foreign investment headlines from the UK and OpenAI's deeper entrenchment in the semiconductor ecosystem fueled optimism. Beyond those factors, little has changed—core inflation ticked higher, consumer delinquencies crept up, and valuations stretched further into uncharted territory. Beneath the surface, concerns linger around the 'circular' nature of semi investments (e.g., NVDA funding partners who then purchase its GPUs), while the government's role in shaping many of these headlines remains front and center. For every bullish driver, there are equally pressing risks: Bull Case - AI remains in the early innings, Street estimates may be systematically too low, and if so, today's valuations could look cheaper in hindsight. Bear Case / Tail Risks - Valuations are pressing near dot-com bubble peaks (~25x vs. 27.5x in 2000), earnings in the frothiest sectors have largely met, not beaten, expectations, and geopolitical and sovereign credit risks are mounting, with yields rising across the U.S., Japan, U.K., Germany, and France. At current levels, much of the future opportunity looks priced in. Upside risks include continued retail momentum (now over 40% of flows), new government-brokered deals, and potential rotation of $7T+ in money-market assets into equities—though historically, such shifts have been rare near market peaks.",
