        Clockwise Capital prioritizes the secure and ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance our
        services while safeguarding client information. Our policy strictly prohibits sharing passwords with AI tools
        and entering client non-public personal information (NPI) without explicit authorization. We work exclusively
        with AI providers that demonstrate robust data protection, commit to not retaining or selling client
        information, and immediately notify us of any breaches. These providers must also indemnify our firm against
        violations and provide annual compliance confirmations. Employees are required to acknowledge this policy
        regularly and adhere to rigorous standards to ensure the integrity of our processes and the trust of our
        clients.

        Clockwise Capital subscribes to QuantStreet Capitalâ€™s model portfolios; Clockwise is a client of QuantStreet.
        Clockwise and QuantStreet also work together to offer outside chief investment officer (OCIO) services to other
        asset managers. This relationship may create a conflict of interest by incentivizing the parties to promote
        each other. QuantStreet develops model portfolios that integrate certain Clockwise strategies in exchange for
        10% of the fee that Clockwise charges applicable clients. Clockwise and QuantStreet also share fees, as
        determined on a case-by-case basis, when clients retain them to provide OCIO services. Since each of the
        parties receives a financial benefit when clients use the model portfolios and OCIO services, the parties are
        incentivized to promote each other. This may create a conflict of interest.
