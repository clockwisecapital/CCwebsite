# Framework Application Guide

## How to Apply Economic Frameworks to Cycle Analysis

This guide explains **exactly how** to use each framework to determine where we are in different economic cycles.

---

## 1. Country Cycle Analysis

### Frameworks to Combine:
- **Strauss & Howe** - Fourth Turning
- **Peter Turchin** - Secular Cycles
- **Arnold Toynbee** - Rise and Fall of Civilizations
- **Ibn Khaldun** - Asabiyyah (Social Cohesion)
- **Fareed Zakaria** - Post-American World

### How to Apply:

#### Step 1: Gather Observable Data Points

```
Current Indicators (2024-2025):
- Institutional Trust: Low (Pew Research polls)
- Political Polarization: High (Congress voting patterns)
- Wealth Inequality: High (Gini coefficient ~0.48)
- Social Cohesion: Declining (social capital studies)
- Generational Alignment: Crisis archetype (Millennials/Gen Z vs Boomers)
- Major Crisis Events: COVID-19, Jan 6, Financial instability
```

#### Step 2: Map to Strauss-Howe Framework

**Strauss-Howe identifies 4 turnings (~20-25 years each):**

| Turning | Characteristics | Timeline Pattern |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| **First (High)** | Strong institutions, conformity, optimism | Post-crisis rebuilding |
| **Second (Awakening)** | Spiritual renewal, question authority | Values shift |
| **Third (Unraveling)** | Weak institutions, individualism | Fragmentation |
| **Fourth (Crisis)** | Institutional collapse → rebuild | 2008-2030? |

**Current Assessment:**
- We entered the Fourth Turning around 2008 (Financial Crisis)
- Fourth Turnings last ~20-25 years
- We're approximately 16-17 years in (2024-2025)
- **Phase Percentage: ~75-80%** (Late-Crisis)

**Why Late-Crisis?**
- Institutions being challenged but not yet rebuilt
- Political realignment happening
- Economic system stress but not collapse
- Still 5-10 years from resolution/new High

#### Step 3: Validate with Turchin's Secular Cycles

**Turchin's Theory:**
- Cycles last ~200-300 years
- Tracks social instability via "Political Stress Indicator"
- Current PSI is at historical peaks (similar to 1860s, 1920s)

**Current Data:**
- Wealth inequality: Peak levels
- Elite overproduction: Yes (too many credentialed people competing)
- State fiscal stress: High debt levels
- Popular immiseration: Wage stagnation

**Turchin's Assessment: Disintegrative Phase**
- Peak instability predicted 2020-2025
- Aligns with Strauss-Howe Crisis period
- **Validates 75-80% through cycle**

#### Step 4: Cross-Check with Zakaria

**Zakaria's Framework:**
- US hegemony declining since 2000s
- Multipolar world emerging
- "Post-American World" = late-stage empire

**Current Indicators:**
- China GDP approaching US
- Dollar dominance questioned (BRICS)
- Military overextension
- **Supports late-cycle positioning**

### AI Prompt for Country Cycle:

```
You are analyzing the Country Cycle for the United States using multiple frameworks.

Current Data (2024-2025):
- Institutional trust: 23% (Pew Research)
- Political polarization index: 8.2/10
- Gini coefficient: 0.48
- Political Stress Indicator (Turchin): 0.89 (peak levels)
- US share of global GDP: 24% (down from 40% in 1960)
- Congressional gridlock: 118th Congress among least productive

Frameworks to apply:
1. Strauss-Howe Fourth Turning (entered ~2008, lasts 20-25 years)
2. Turchin Secular Cycles (disintegrative phase, peak instability 2020-2025)
3. Zakaria Post-American World (late-stage hegemony)

Based on this analysis:
1. What phase are we in? (High/Awakening/Unraveling/Crisis)
2. What % through the cycle? (0-100%)
3. When did this cycle start?
4. What's the best historical analog period?

## 2. Technology Cycle Analysis

### Frameworks to Combine:
- **Carlota Perez** - Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital
- **Kondratiev Waves** - Long-wave economic cycles
- **Joseph Schumpeter** - Creative Destruction
- **Geoffrey Moore** - Technology Adoption Lifecycle
- **Ray Kurzweil** - Law of Accelerating Returns

### How to Apply:

#### Step 1: Identify Current Tech Revolution

**Carlota Perez Framework:**
Every major tech revolution follows this pattern (~40-60 years):

| Phase | Duration | Characteristics | Finance Behavior |
|-------|----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Installation** | 20-30 years | Infrastructure building | Bubble forms, speculation |
| **Frenzy** | 2-3 years | Peak hype, bubble | Crash/correction |
| **Synergy** | 10-15 years | Real productivity gains | Stable growth |
| **Maturity** | 10-15 years | Diminishing returns | Seek new paradigm |

**Current Tech Revolution: Digital/AI (began ~1971)**

Timeline:
- 1971: Microprocessor invented (Intel 4004)
- 1971-1995: Installation (PCs, networks, software)
- 1995-2000: Frenzy (Dot-com bubble)
- 2001-2008: Deployment begins (Internet maturity)
- 2008-2020: Synergy (Mobile, cloud, platforms)
- 2020-2025: **AI Installation Phase** (new sub-cycle)

#### Step 2: Analyze AI Sub-Cycle

**Current AI Indicators:**
- ChatGPT released: Nov 2022
- Massive capital inflows: $200B+ in AI investment (2023-2024)
- Infrastructure build-out: NVIDIA datacenter GPUs, cloud capacity
- Hype cycle: Peak valuations for AI companies
- Limited real productivity gains: Still early

**Perez Assessment:**
- We're in **"Frenzy"** phase of AI revolution
- Massive speculation, high valuations
- Infrastructure being built but not yet deployed
- **Phase: 60-70% through current cycle**

#### Step 3: Map to Kondratiev Waves

**Kondratiev's 50-60 Year Cycles:**

| Wave | Period | Driver | Phase Now |
|------|--------|--------|-----------|
| 1st | 1780-1830 | Steam, textiles | - |
| 2nd | 1830-1880 | Railways, steel | - |
| 3rd | 1880-1930 | Electricity, chemicals | - |
| 4th | 1930-1970 | Auto, petrochemicals | - |
| 5th | 1970-2020 | IT, telecom | **Maturity** |
| 6th | 2020-2070 | AI, biotech, renewable | **Early** |

**Current Position:**
- Transitioning from 5th to 6th wave
- Digital tech maturing, AI emerging
- Still early in 6th wave (5-10% through)

**But within 5th wave:**
- Started 1971, now 2024 = 53 years in
- Typical wave = 50-60 years
- **~90% through 5th wave**

#### Step 4: Synthesize

**Combined Assessment:**
- 5th Kondratiev Wave (Digital): 90% complete, maturing
- AI Sub-Cycle (Perez): 65% through, Frenzy→Synergy transition
- **Overall: 65-70% through technology cycle**

### AI Prompt for Technology Cycle:

```
Analyze the current Technology Cycle using these frameworks:

Current Tech Landscape (2024-2025):
- AI investment: $200B+ (2023-2024)
- ChatGPT users: 100M+ weekly active
- NVIDIA market cap: $3T+ (up 10x in 2 years)
- Cloud infrastructure spending: $250B annually
- AI productivity gains: Still limited (<5% productivity boost)
- Hype cycle: Peak expectations

Historical Context:
- 5th Kondratiev Wave (IT/Digital) began 1971
- Internet/mobile infrastructure mature
- AI breakthrough: 2022 (ChatGPT moment)

Apply these frameworks:
1. Carlota Perez (Installation → Frenzy → Synergy → Maturity)
2. Kondratiev Waves (50-60 year cycles)
3. Schumpeter Creative Destruction (old tech dying, new emerging)

Determine:
1. Current phase (Installation/Frenzy/Synergy/Maturity)
2. % through cycle
3. When did current cycle start?
4. Best historical analog (e.g., 1995-2000 dot-com?)

Return JSON with unified assessment.

## 3. Economic Cycle (Long-Term Debt) Analysis

### Frameworks to Combine:
- **Ray Dalio** - Big Debt Cycle
- **Nikolai Kondratiev** - Long Economic Waves
- **Hyman Minsky** - Financial Instability Hypothesis
- **George Modelski** - Long Political Cycles

### How to Apply:

#### Step 1: Ray Dalio's Big Debt Cycle Framework

**Dalio identifies phases based on debt levels:**

| Phase | Debt Level | Characteristics | Typical Duration |
|-------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Early Cycle** | Low debt | Credit expanding, growth | 10-15 years |
| **Mid Cycle** | Moderate | Strong growth, asset inflation | 15-20 years |
| **Late Cycle** | High debt | Financialization dominates | 5-10 years |
| **Crisis** | Peak debt | Deleveraging, defaults | 2-5 years |
| **Depression** | Falling debt | Restructuring | 5-10 years |

**Current US Data (2024):**
- Federal debt: $34 trillion (120% of GDP)
- Total debt (public + private): 350% of GDP
- Debt service as % of GDP: Rising (interest rates up)
- Credit expansion: Slowing

**Dalio's Assessment:**
- Started rebuilding after 2008 crisis
- Massive debt accumulation 2008-2024
- We're in **"Late Autumn"** (late expansion, high debt)
- **Next phase: Winter (deleveraging)**
- **Cycle position: 80-85%**

#### Step 2: Apply Minsky's Financial Instability Hypothesis

**Minsky's 3 Types of Finance:**

1. **Hedge Finance** (Early Cycle)
   - Borrowers can pay principal + interest from cash flow
   - Low risk, sustainable

2. **Speculative Finance** (Mid Cycle)
   - Can only pay interest, must roll over principal
   - Moderate risk

3. **Ponzi Finance** (Late Cycle)
   - Cannot pay interest OR principal
   - Rely on asset price appreciation
   - High risk, unstable

**Current Indicators (2024):**
- Corporate debt rollovers: At record highs
- "Zombie companies": 20%+ of S&P 500 (can't cover interest)
- Private equity leverage: Record levels
- Real estate: Negative cash flow common
- Crypto/speculation: Still elevated despite 2022 crash

**Minsky Assessment: Transition to Ponzi Finance**
- Speculative excesses building
- Asset prices disconnected from fundamentals
- **Late cycle, fragile system**
- **Validates 80-85% positioning**

#### Step 3: Check Historical Position (Modelski)

**Modelski's 100-Year Cycles of World Power:**
- US dominance began post-WWII (~1945)
- Typical hegemony lasts 80-120 years
- We're ~80 years in (2025)
- **Late stage of US financial hegemony**

**Evidence:**
- Dollar as reserve currency: Declining (58% of reserves, down from 70%)
- BRICS currency discussions
- US debt sustainability questioned
- **Supports late-cycle assessment**

### AI Prompt for Economic Cycle:

```
Analyze the Long-Term Economic Cycle (Debt Supercycle) using:

Current Economic Data (2024-2025):
- US Federal Debt: $34T (120% of GDP)
- Total Debt/GDP: 350%
- Interest payments: $1T+ annually
- Zombie companies: 20% of S&P 500
- Private equity leverage: 7x EBITDA average
- Dollar share of reserves: 58% (down from 70% in 2000)
- Credit impulse: Negative (credit growth slowing)

Historical Context:
- Post-WWII economic order established 1944 (Bretton Woods)
- Fiat currency system began 1971 (Nixon shock)
- Last major deleveraging: 2008-2012

Apply these frameworks:
1. Ray Dalio Big Debt Cycle (early/mid/late/crisis/depression)
2. Minsky Financial Instability (hedge/speculative/ponzi finance)
3. Kondratiev Long Waves (50-60 year cycles)
4. Modelski World Power Cycles (US hegemony timeline)

Determine:
1. Current phase (Spring/Summer/Autumn/Winter)
2. % through cycle
3. Cycle start date
4. Best historical analog (1920s? 1970s? 2007?)

## 4. Business Cycle (Short-Term) Analysis

### Frameworks to Combine:
- **Ray Dalio** - Short-Term Debt Cycle (7-10 years)
- **NBER** - Business Cycle Dating
- **Federal Reserve** - Taylor Rule / Output Gap
- **Hyman Minsky** - Credit Cycles

### How to Apply:

#### Step 1: Gather Current Economic Indicators

**Real-Time Data (fetch from FRED API):**
```python
indicators = {
    'gdp_growth': 2.8%,        # Real GDP growth (Q3 2024)
    'unemployment': 3.9%,      # U-3 unemployment
    'inflation': 3.2%,         # CPI year-over-year
    'fed_funds_rate': 5.50%,   # Current Fed rate
    'yield_curve': -0.15%,     # 10Y - 2Y spread (inverted!)
    'payroll_growth': 150k/mo, # Average job growth
    'capacity_utilization': 79% # Factory utilization
}
```

#### Step 2: Apply NBER Framework

**NBER Business Cycle Phases:**
1. **Expansion** - GDP growing, unemployment falling
2. **Peak** - Maximum output, tight labor market
3. **Contraction** - GDP falling, unemployment rising
4. **Trough** - Bottom, before recovery begins

**Current Assessment (2024):**
- GDP: Still growing (2.8%)
- Unemployment: Low but rising (was 3.4%, now 3.9%)
- Job growth: Slowing (was 300k/mo, now 150k)
- **Phase: Late Expansion → Peak**

#### Step 3: Check Fed Policy (Taylor Rule)

**Taylor Rule Formula:**
```
Optimal Fed Rate = Neutral Rate + 0.5(Inflation Gap) + 0.5(Output Gap)

Where:
- Neutral rate ≈ 2.5%
- Inflation gap = Actual inflation - Target (3.2% - 2% = 1.2%)
- Output gap = (Actual GDP - Potential GDP) / Potential GDP ≈ 0.5%

Calculation:
= 2.5% + 0.5(1.2%) + 0.5(0.5%)
= 2.5% + 0.6% + 0.25%
= 3.35%

Actual Fed Rate: 5.50%
Fed is RESTRICTIVE (1.85% above neutral)
```

**Implication:** Fed is actively cooling the economy

#### Step 4: Yield Curve Signal

**Inverted Yield Curve:**
- 10Y-2Y spread: -0.15% (inverted)
- Has been inverted since July 2022
- Historical pattern: Recession follows inversion by 12-18 months

**Timeline:**
- Inversion began: July 2022
- Now: Nov 2024 (28 months later)
- Historical average: Recession by now OR imminent

#### Step 5: Synthesize

**Combined Business Cycle Assessment:**
- NBER: Late expansion
- Fed policy: Restrictive
- Yield curve: Warning of recession
- Labor market: Softening
- **Phase: 70-75% through expansion**
- **Next: Likely slowdown/mild recession 2025**

### AI Prompt for Business Cycle:

```

## 5. Putting It All Together

### Integration Workflow

```python
def analyze_all_cycles():
    # 1. Fetch real data
    market_data = get_sp500_data()
    economic_data = get_economic_indicators()
    
    # 2. Use AI to apply frameworks
    country_analysis = ai_analyze_country_cycle()
    tech_analysis = ai_analyze_technology_cycle()
    economic_analysis = ai_analyze_economic_cycle(economic_data)
    business_analysis = ai_analyze_business_cycle(economic_data)
    
    # 3. Cross-validate
    # If all cycles show late-stage, confidence is high
    # If mixed, flag for manual review
    
    # 4. Generate historical analogs using AI
    analogs = ai_find_historical_analogs({
        'country': country_analysis,
        'tech': tech_analysis,
        'economic': economic_analysis,
        'business': business_analysis
    })
    
    return {
        'cycles': {
            'country': country_analysis,
            'technology': tech_analysis,
            'economic': economic_analysis,
            'business': business_analysis
        },
        'analogs': analogs
    }
```

## Key Takeaways

### Framework Application = Data + Theory + AI

1. **Gather Observable Data**
   - Economic indicators (FRED)
   - Market data (Yahoo Finance)
   - Social indicators (Pew, Gallup)

2. **Map to Framework Predictions**
   - Each framework has specific markers
   - Look for alignment across frameworks
   - Contradictions indicate uncertainty

3. **Use AI to Synthesize**
   - AI is good at pattern matching
   - Can compare current conditions to historical periods
   - Generates "best fit" assessment

4. **Cross-Validate**
   - Multiple frameworks pointing same direction = high confidence
   - Divergent frameworks = flag for review
   - Historical analogs confirm or challenge assessment

### This Is NOT Just AI Guessing

The process is:
1. **Objective data** (GDP, inflation, debt levels, etc.)
2. **Established frameworks** (Dalio, Strauss-Howe, etc. - public knowledge)
3. **AI synthesis** (applies frameworks to current data)
4. **Validation** (cross-check across multiple frameworks)

This is rigorous analysis, not speculation!
